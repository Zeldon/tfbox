# tfbox
This is a box setup to work on tensorflow stuff. A gui will be presented via flask, to abstract out some pre-processing and logistics, however the documentation will also be included to explain the code and logic behind it.

### TODOs
1. Overview pipeline.
2. Model Choices.
3. Pipeline Explanation.
4. GUI controls.
